## Accessing and Managing Views with Workbooks
Workbooks are enabled in Log Analytics workspaces as an item in the side navigation bar, directly under the View Designer location

While View Designer manages views through the Workspace summary, Workbooks utilizes a gallery that displays saved workbooks and templates for your workspace. Users can utilize the gallery as a gateway for accessing, modifying, and creating views.

To start a new workbook, you may select the Empty template under Quick start, or the + New icon in the top navigation bar. To view templates or return to saved workbooks, select the item from the gallery or search for the name in the search bar.

To save a workbook, you will need to save the report with a specific title, subscription, resource group, and location.
The workbook will auto-fill to the same settings as the LA workspace, with the same subscription, resource group, however, users may change these report settings. Workbooks are by default saved to 'My Reports', accessible only by the individual user. But can be saved directly to shared reports or shared later on.
