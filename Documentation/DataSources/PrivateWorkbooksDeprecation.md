# Private Workbooks Deprecation

Private Workbooks is going away by the end of 2020. You will still be able to access your private workbooks but any edit or save can only be saved as a Shared Workbook. 

# Why? 
There are several inconsistencies with the private workbook type that cause issues and confusion. 

# How should you proceed?
You can go to your private workbook and click "Save As" and select the "Shared Report" option from the drop down. If you don't want others to have access to your workbook, you can manually change the RBAC to deny access to others. If your private workbook is not migrated to a shared one by the time of deprecation, it may be too incompatible to migrate or even removed altogether. 

# When is it going to deprecated?
As of right now, the target deprecation date is 11/30/2020
